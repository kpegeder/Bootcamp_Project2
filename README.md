# Bootcamp_Project2

Our goal for this project was to create a social media platform that connects users by commonalities based on their favorite movies. Then with that data, users can pick a movie to watch. Our simple yet powerful interface makes finding movies and comparing with other users easy and hassle-free!

## Walkthrough

The user goes to our website and from there they can either sign-up for the first time or log-in as a returning user.
